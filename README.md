# MIDI-UART interface-san Kit
MIDI UART interrace-san is a handy interface PCB for MIDI and microcontrollers with commonly used basic circuit when you start developping  MIDI-related  MCU project, e.g. TRS jacks for MIDI I/O, optocouplers, digital buffers, etc. It means by using this PCB, you do not have to repeat soldering/making a breadboard for these purpose anymore.

You can choose both 5V and 3.3V for power supply(can be selected jumper pins), to match the voltage your of MCU.
